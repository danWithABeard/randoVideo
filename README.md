randoVideo
==========

Load a random video on page load with a random image fallback for mobile devices and unsupported browsers.

This project is a proof of concept to be incorporated into another project later this year. 
Still working on a few bugs for larger monitors and mobile devices.

This project does require external video files to be inlcuded within video directory.
