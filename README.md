randoVideo
==========

Load a random video on page load with a random image fallback for mobile devices and unsupported browsers.

This project is a proof of concept to be incorporated into another project later this year. 
Still working on a few bugs for larger monitors and mobile devices.

This project does require external video files to be inlcuded within the video directory. You can accomodate for your video titles within the /js/script.js file.

You can see a live version here: http://danwithabeard.com/randoVideo/
